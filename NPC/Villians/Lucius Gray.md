## Overview

- Owns the Company **OracleAI**
- Obsessed with artificial intelligence, he’s experimenting with binding spirits, fey, and even ghosts into machine-learning models. His flagship project, **OracleMind**, is an AI fueled by captured seers and oracles, granting near-perfect predictive capabilities.
### Twist
His tech isn’t predicting the future—it’s _rewriting_ it. His AI’s predictions become self-fulfilling, subtly altering fate.

## Appearance

The first thing you notice about Lucius Gray—aside from the crisp, almost unnaturally flawless suit—are his eyes,  a bright amber that almost comes off as bronze. 
They gleam. Not with the hunger of a predator, but with the cool, controlled ambition of someone who’s already decided he’ll own the future. His hair is a perfect shade of platinum blond, slicked back just enough to give him that sense of "I’m too important to let it get messy".

He carries himself with a confidence that borders on arrogance. He walks into a room like the _room_ should be honored to be in his presence—his words are measured, controlled, his cadence calculated. Don’t be fooled by his politeness or that faux-smile he wears like a badge of honor. Underneath it, there's a predator's cold calculation, wrapped in a designer suit and a sharp tongue.
