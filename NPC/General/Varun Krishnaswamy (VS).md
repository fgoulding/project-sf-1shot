- generally goes by VS

## Role
Detective/Investigator - an ally to the players who are looking for information
## Appearance

His **dark brown skin**, rich and warm, contrasts against the cool, polished surfaces of his world, and those sharp eyes, bright with intensity. Thick eyebrows with a seemingly permenantly furrowed brow

Varun’s hair is just a bit messy, but intentionally so. A well-trimmed beard grazes his chin, with an easy smile when he wants to disarm someone, but that smile is often fleeting, replaced by a deep concentration when he’s working. 

In a magical world, there is something disarming about being human. 
## Located

VS can usually be found at either [[Mythical Cup]] or The Basement at [[Dumpling Apartment]]
